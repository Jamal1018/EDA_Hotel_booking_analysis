# EDA_Hotel_booking_analysis
**PROJECT SUMMARY** 

This hotel booking dataset contains booking information for city and resort hotel. It consists of 1,19,390 observations with 31 variables. Each observation represents a hotel booking. The dataset comprehens bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were cancelled.We are here to explore a hotel booking dataset to discover important factors that govern the bookings, which contain booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel.We will analyze some important aspects of hotel bookings which will helps us identify major loopholes and give us insights which will be helpful to run profitable hotel business.Our analysis can help us understand about the given data and draw some useful insights to make some crucial business decisions regarding the factors affecting the bookings of the hotels.In hotel industry, cancellations and average daily rate(ADR) are two important factos that effects the business. By understanding the factors that are determining the cancellation of a certain booking, the hotels can take necessary precautions to reduce Cancellation rate. By understanding the patterns in ADR against different variables, the hotels can be prepared in advance to generate more revenue and help make a profitable business. Our goal here is to understand such factors in the given data set by performing exploratory data analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns, to spot anomalies, to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.The following are the various steps performed as a part of Exploratory Data Analysis:
 - Data Preparation 
 - Data Cleaning 
 - Univariate Analysis 
 - Bivariate Analysis 
 - Multivariate Analysis

Data Preparation: Firstly, we imported libraries and dataset, some of the libraries used are NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, warnings. Once the data is collected, process of analysis begins. But data has to be translated in an appropriate form. This process is known as Data Preparation

Data Cleaning: The raw data received in the data set might not be directly suitable for analysis due to presence of unwanted data like, duplicate values, null values, outliers etc. We need to handle them first before we proceed with further analysis.

Removing Duplicates: The duplicate values in the dataset to be removed so that we get accurate patterns and numbers regarding the analysis.

Handling null/missing values: It is also possible that the given data set can contain missing information for some or all features in some records, we need to either remove them or find alternatives to fill up the null values. 

Univariate Analysis: In Univariate Analysis, we choose a single feature from the data and try to determine what the output or the target value is, i.e., one feature/variable at a time. 
- Understand the trends and patterns of data 
- Analyze the frequency and other such characteristics of data 
- Know the distribution of the variables in the data. 
- Visualize the relationship that may exist between different variables.

Bivariate Analysis: In a Bivariate Analysis, we try to analyze two features instead of one, and finally determine the classification of output we are looking for. It is a methodical statistical technique applied to a pair of variables (features/ attributes) of data to determine the empirical relationship between them. In order words, it is meant to determine any concurrent relations. We have performed the following analysis as a part of Bivariate analysis

Multivariate Analysis: In Multivariate analysis we analyze three or more different features at a time, to understand the relationship between all the features involved.

After completing all the above processes, final conclusion has been observed from the patterns of the analysis and spotted anamolies to increase the business objective.Few points have observed to increase the business growth and practical insights have drawn from the analysis on cancellations and ADR.The hotels should implement all the necessary steps and plans for the business. The hotels should focus on the marketing strategy to increase the occupancy by providing special offers, discounts to the group/families in the respective months as per our analysis to increase the business growth.
